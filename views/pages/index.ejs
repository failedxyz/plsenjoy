						<ul>
							<li>Your rank must be <b>between 1,000 and 20,000</b> to register. You rank must remain <b>between 900 and 21,000</b> to continue playing in the tournament.</li>
							<li>A player failing a map has the opportunity to revive and his/her score will not be invalidated. However, a team fail will count as a loss.</li>
							<li>Room will be ready 10 minutes before the scheduled time.</li>
							<li><b>If more than one player arrives later than 15 min. after the match was supposed to begin, the late team automatically forfeits.</b></li>
							<li>If a player, for whatever reason, disconnects during a match, that team can ask for a rematch once per match if only the match is affected significantly (as in, the disconnection was the deciding factor), and the other team has the choice of accepting or refusing the request.</li>
							<li>Any non-accidental disconnections will result in a team ban from the tournament.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Group Stage</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Highest score wins.</li>
							<li>Best of 5.</li>
							<li>Tiebreaker when both teams are at match point.</li>
							<li>Ties in group stage will be resolved by number of maps won, if that fails then the tied teams will play the tiebraker map in a best of 1.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Double Elimination</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>At the end of each map, the player on <b>either side</b> with the LOWEST score will lose a life; this is the Last Man Standing concept - if a player is out of lives, they are considered out of the round, and their score will no longer be counted for the rest of the match (they can choose whether to stay in the MP room or not).</li>
							<li>The tiebreaker map will be played if both teams have a total of one life each, and <b>team score will matter regardless of lives (team with the highest collective score wins).</b></li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Quarterfinals</h4>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Best of 7 (Each player starts with 2 lives each).</b></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="page-header">
							<h4>Semifinals & Grandfinals</h4>
						</div>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Best of 11 (Each player starts with 3 lives each).</b></li>
						</ul>
						<div class="page-header">
							<h4>The Match</h4>
						</div>
						<ul>
							<li>One member of each team will !roll, and the one with the higher number can choose either to ban first or second.</li>
							<li>Each team alternates banning maps until there are a total of 4 banned maps (each team has a total of <b>2</b> banned maps).</li>
							<li>Tiebreaker cannot be banned.</li>
							<li>The higher rolling team gets to pick the first warm-up map <b>and</b> the first actual map.</li>
							<li>Warm-up maps must be less than <b>5:30</b></li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Substitutions</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>If a team wishes to substitute a player, the substitute does not get a new stock of full lives but receives the number of lives held by the player subbed out for the substitute.</li>
							<li>There is to be only one substitution per map.</li>
							<li>Two active players can not substitute for one another.</li>
